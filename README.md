# ClickyHW
For this assignment, I will create a memory game with React. The program will require me to break up the application's UI into components, manage component state, and respond to user events.

The application will keep track of the user's score. The user's score should be incremented when clicking an image for the first time. The user's score should be reset to 0 if they click the same image more than once.
Every time an image is clicked, the images rendered to the page should shuffle themselves in a random order.
Once the user's score is reset after an incorrect guess, the game should restart.
